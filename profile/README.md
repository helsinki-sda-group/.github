## Featured Research

### 1. A reinforcement learning-based metaheuristic algorithm for on-demand ride-pooling
- **Description**: In this paper, we introduce a ride-pooling algorithm in which reinforcement learning (RL) controls the parameters of a centralized dispatching procedure, enabling it to adapt to the dynamic nature of demand and achieve near-optimal results. The experimental evaluation utilizes a custom Gym environment integrated with the SUMO traffic simulation software.

### 2. Simulation-based origin-destination matrix reduction: a case study of Helsinki city area
- **Description**: In this paper, we introduce an algorithm and a pipeline for traffic demand estimation and calibration. Our approach utilizes country-wide origin-destination (OD) matrices as input to generate city-wide ODs, while traffic counts serve as ground-truth data for calibration. We evaluate our method in the Helsinki city area and provide [SUMO traffic simulator network and route files](https://github.com/helsinki-sda-group/AIforLEssAuto/tree/main/WP4/sumo-hki-cm/demo) for the entire city, along with several smaller regions within it.
